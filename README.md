## Goal

Learn how to demonstrate the value of Customer Journey Analytics on a real customer problem. 
Level up your Customer Journey Analytics technical selling skills.

## Workshop Framing

Thanks for joining this event. You will soon learn more about the capabilities of Customer Journey Analytics, what problems it can solve, and how you can pitch it to your prospects. Later in the day, you will try to solve a real customer challenge using a ready-made Customer Journey Analytics sandbox. Finally, do a demo pitch yourself and get instant feedback from Adobe experts.

Here is the situation setup:

You've just completed the discovery and found a great solution with CJA to solve your prospects challenge. You will be meeting with their representatives to present your pitch and show your solution in action (incl. CMO, Intelligence Manager, Director of Privacy, CRO).
	
Based on the given scenario, you will need to do the following:
	
* Explore the situation given the customer's current challenges (discovery).
* Discuss various options with your team mates (solution).
* Create a pitch and outline your solution to the customer representatives (presentation).
* With the demo environment at your fingertips, make yourself comfortable using it. Customize it and show it in action (demo).

## Customer Pitch

The whole presentation (pitch) shouldn't take longer than 10 minutes and will be followed by a short 5 mins Q&A.

When building your presentation try to consider these aspects of a great customer pitch:

* Collaboration and completeness,
* Potential value and viability of the idea,
* Innovation/Creativity,
* Demonstration - Focus on a customer journey and business value (not product capabilities).

## Breakouts

During the day, each attendee will be assigned to a team. Each team will try to solve a given scenario from the list below (in the breakout part). But before we do that, we will show you how Adobe does a Customer Journey Analytics pitch. You can take this as an inspiration for your own assignment and there will also be enough time for you to ask questions to the Adobe experts.


### Scenario 0: SecurFinancial (FSI) -- WILL BE PRESENTED BY ADOBE SOLUTION CONSULTANT

Challenge:

* SecureFinancial wants to use CJA to understand which digital experiences are not meeting customer expectations that result in support calls. ​
* The org siloes by BU and channel owner create competing interests with limited incentives to collaborate.  Customer touch points are often managed by different systems that require bespoke IT integrations limit real-time response and coordination.

### Scenario A: Luma (Retail)

Challenge:

* Luma realized they needed to prioritize creating a single source of truth for customer data, eliminating the need to run multiple ad-hoc SQL queries to gain insights about their customer segments.
* Understanding customer behavior is increasingly challenging as consumers engage in digital channels while most of retail revenue still comes from in-store transactions. Siloed data sources exist across the enterprise with many branches leveraging legacy systems of record (e.g. Google Analytics UA).

### Scenario B: SecurFinancial (FSI)

Challenge:

* SecurFinancial focus is geared towards leveraging data across multiple channels and devices with enhanced reporting for account growth (been using Adobe Analytics so far).
* Struggling to extract meaningful insights from its wealth of data.  It’s hobbled by data siloes across BUs, incompatible formats, privacy concerns and regulations that specify what data can/can’t be used which can require audit and approval of models for targeting.

### Scenario C: Carvelo (Auto)

Challenge:

* Carvelo spent years amassing customer data in a proprietary data lake but didn’t have the means to activate it, build audience segments, or automate marketing activities. 
* Data is siloed across systems, teams, business units, dealers and agencies with limited ability to connect information – nascent abilities to create enterprise-wide profiles.

### Scenario D: City Signal (Telco)

Challenge:

* The new City Signal leadership focused on customer has set its sights on truly transforming their entire business from end-to-end, and calls for personalization with real-time data to ring up growth (they purchased Adobe RTCDP 6 months ago).
* Siloed data & legacy tech make it difficult to understand and anticipate customer needs.

## Tips and Tricks
* For every new DSN demo run always use Anonymous (incognito) window or reset the mobile app profile.
* When creating new profile append the email address and phone number with a hash (e.g. date and demo run, 20220707-01).
* If you can't access AEP  - make sure you're using the Business ID (not Personal Adobe ID).
* Connection is using crmId as PersonID - which means only hits having this attribute will get ingested to CJA.
* Installing the Mobile App: https://dsn.adobe.com/install
* Try sending Call Center API Call to EMEA-CJA-A: https://reqbin.com/c-foymzygm.
* Look at the CJA API: https://developer.adobe.com/cja-apis/docs/
