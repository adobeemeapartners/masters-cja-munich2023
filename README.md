## Goal

Learn how to do multi-channel analysis on any of your Experience Platform data sets. Level up your Customer Journey Analytics technical selling skills.

## Workshop Framing

Thanks for joining this event and learn about the capabilities of Customer Journey Analytics, what problems it can solve, and how you can pitch it to your prospects. Later in the day, you can try to solve a real customer analytics challenge using a ready-made Customer Journey Analytics sandbox. Finally, try to do a demo pitch yourself and get instant feedback from Adobe experts.

Here is the situation setup:

You've just completed the discovery with your new prospect for CJA and you will meet with their representatives to present your pitch solving their challenge (incl. CMO, Business Analyst, Intelligence Manager, Director of Privacy, Director of Operations).
	
Based on the given scenario, you will need to do the following:
	
* Explore the situation given the customer's current challenges.
* Discuss various options with your team mates (discovery phase).
* Create your presentation and pitch your solution to the customer representatives.
* With the CJA Adobe demo environment at your fingertips, make yourself comfortable using it, customize it and show your solution in action to the customer as part of your pitch.

## Customer Pitch

The whole presentation (pitch) shouldn't take longer than 10 minutes and will be followed by a short 5 mins Q&A.

When building your presentation try to consider these aspects of a great customer pitch:

* Collaboration and Completeness
* Potential value and viability of the idea
* Innovation/Creativity
* Demonstration - Focus on a customer and solution value (not product capabilities)

## Breakouts

Each attendee will be assigned to a team and each team will together try to solve a given scenario from the list below (in the breakout part of the day).

Firstly, we will show you how Adobe does a Customer Journey Analytics pitch. You can take this as an inspiration for your own assignment and there will also be enough time for you to ask any question to the Adobe experts.


### Scenario 0: SecurFinancial (FSI) -- WILL BE PRESENTED BY ADOBE SOLUTION CONSULTANT

Challenge:

* SecureFinancial wants to use CJA to understand which digital experiences are not meeting customer expectations that result in support calls. ​
* The org siloes by BU and channel owner create competing interests with limited incentives to collaborate.  Customer touch points are often managed by different systems that require bespoke IT integrations limit real-time response and coordination.


### Scenario A: Luma (Retail)

Challenge:

* Luma realized they needed to prioritize creating a single source of truth for customer data, eliminating the need to run multiple ad-hoc SQL queries to gain insights about their customer segments.
* Understanding customer behavior is increasingly challenging as consumers engage in digital channels while most of retail revenue still comes from in-store transactions. Siloed data sources exist across the enterprise with many retailers leveraging legacy systems of record (e.g. Google Analytics UA).

### Scenario B: SecurFinancial (FSI)

Challenge:

* SecurFinancial focus is geared towards leveraging data across multiple channels and devices with enhanced reporting for account growth (been using Adobe Analytics so far).
* Struggling to extract meaningful insights from its wealth of data.  It’s hobbled by data siloes across BUs, incompatible formats, privacy concerns and regulations that specify what data can/can’t be used which can require audit and approval of models for targeting.

### Scenario C: Carvelo (Auto)

Challenge:

* Carvelo spent years amassing customer data in a proprietary data lake but didn’t have the means to activate it, build audience segments, or automate marketing activities. 
* Data is siloed across systems, teams, business units, dealers and agencies with limited ability to connect information – nascent abilities to create enterprise-wide profiles.

### Scenario D: City Signal (Telco)

Challenge:

* The new City Signal leadership focused on customer has set its sights on truly transforming their entire business from end-to-end, and calls for personalization with real-time data to ring up growth (they purchased Adobe RTCDP 6 months ago).
* Siloed data & legacy tech make it difficult to understand and anticipate customer needs.
